# Text Generation Model with Deep Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a Text Generation Model using Deep Learning techniques in Python. The model is designed to generate human-like text based on a given seed string, utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. We use the Tiny Shakespeare dataset for training, which contains text from Shakespeare's plays, providing a suitable dataset for generating dialogue-style text.

## Project Description

Text Generation Models have various applications, such as content creation, chatbots, automated story writing, and more. These models typically use deep learning techniques, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), and Transformer models like GPT.

This project demonstrates the process of building a simple RNN-based text generation model using the TensorFlow framework.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- TensorFlow Datasets
- NumPy


## Model Building Process
We follow a step-by-step approach to build the Text Generation Model:

1. **Dataset Loading:** We use the Tiny Shakespeare dataset available from TensorFlow Datasets, which contains a collection of Shakespeare's plays.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** The text data is cleaned, tokenized, and converted to integer sequences.
3. **Model Definition:** A simple LSTM-based model is used for text generation.
4. **Compilation:** The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Training the Model
We train the model using the dataset with the following configurations:

- **Epochs:** 10
- **Batch Size:** 64
- **Checkpointing:** We save model weights at each epoch to continue training later if needed.

## Text Generation
After training, we can generate text by providing a seed string. The model predicts the next character iteratively to create coherent sequences.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build a text generation model using a Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM cells. The trained model can generate text in the style of Shakespeare's plays, making it suitable for various applications like creative writing, chatbots, or dialogue generation.
